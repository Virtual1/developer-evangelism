#How to make the most out of meetups
As part of your job of being an evangelist you will most likely decide to showcase your product not only with your online presence, but also by presenting to people at gatherings, meetups and conferences how innovative and groundbreaking your offering is, without being taken for a sales person.

## Pitching is about deliverying value
Obviously, you shouldn't boast about your company's greatness - no one likes a boaster.
When you're going to a meetup you will meet 5 type of people

####The expert 
- A veteran in the technology, has been coming to the meetup since forever and is most likely involved with the organisation of the meetup itself.(Or a speaker at the meetup)

####The intermediate
- Has been using the techonlogy but at the same time its not part of their main stack. Has a good grasp and idea of what to do and not to do with it.

####The newbie
- Has little clue about the technology, wants to learn more and will want to hear experts talk and listen to learn.

####The non-dev
- Has just started coding, has little to no development skill

####I'm here for the free booze
Instead, simply try to open a dialogue with other developers with a ice-breakers.

## Breaking the ice

Opening and starting a dialogue is not hard, and because you're an extroverted person you won't have any problems with finding people to chat with.

Being a great evangelist also means you get to talk to **everybody**, sometimes the quiet dude or dudette sitting in a corner looking panicked because he/she does not know anyone in the room is your best ally. Always keep an eye on the quiet attendees, they're interesting people too! You should, as an evangelist, try to make everyone feel comfortable as they're also part of your community - the community you're going to evangelise.
In case you need a few pointers on how to open a dialogue with devs or attendees at meetups here's a few:

####General opening
   "Hey I'm BOB, I'm a dev working at XYZ Inc, we make car-flying technology..what about you?"

####When you spot someone with a nerdy tshirt or an event shirt
   "Hey I love your t-shirt, where did you get it from? Did you attend XYZ event, how was it?"

####When you spot someone wearing a tshirt of one of your competitors:
   "Hey there, woah great t-shirt are you a customer of theirs? What do you think of their product?"


##Evangelising at meetups is about selling help
When engaging with developers your aim is to understand what they're working on and try to understand whether you can provide your help (this works very well for side projects) or if you think your technology could make their dev-life better: If your a company's product  makes it super simple to send text messages and the person you're having a chat with is telling you about how they're working on setting up 2-factor-authentication, you should understand immediately that there is space to explain how you could help them speed up their go-to-production time of this feature.
