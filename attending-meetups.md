#How to make the most out of meetups
As part of your job of being an evangelist you will most likely decide to showcase your product not only with your online presence, but also by presenting to people at gatherings, meetups and conferences how innovative and groundbreaking your offering is, without being taken for a sales person.

##Picking the right meetup
It is important to speak to the right crowd. If you start fresh in a new city or if you've never done evangelism before you should be acquainted with your surroundings in the tech scene. The decisions you will take will influence a lot the way you will schedule your time as an evangelist.
Ultimately the right crowd of people is, everyone. But as a dev-evangelist you need to start small and then reach out to wider crowds.
How to find out who the right crowd is? Well that's not an easy question, surely it is people who can integrate your product, if you have a wrapper written in Python, you can try and attend the Python meetup and see what people have to say - if you're developing a tool for online retail shopping and you're evangelising it, maybe the Shopify or Magento meetups are a good start.
There are two ways of doing this really, one I call it the brute-force method and one is the scientific method.
###Brute-Force
The first method requires you to book 2 or 3 weeks of your evenings in a row as you will be attending as many meetups as possible. 
* Compile a list of meetups that are available in your area and that are *active*.
* Try to fit one meetup per day (usually evenings)
* Understand the quality of the meetup (more on this later in this chapter)
* Try to identify and introduce yourself to the organisers / keyplayers
* Go home and the morning after write a note about it for your records

###Scientific method
This methord requires more time to set-up and requires you to look into speakers, topics, tweets and general chit chatter in your community. Twitter, Lanyrd, Facebook and anything else you can put your hands will be good. Data-driven meetup discovery is harder. However using this way you can understand what are the most popular meetups where people show-up regularly, the topics and the general vibe. Those that you will identify are **key** meetups that you need to attend every time they happen.
Some key points to look out for.
* Keep an eye to see if the meetup is sponsored by anyone, they could be partners or competitors, make a note.
* Understand if there is any kind of audio/video recording, this is huge for you if you manage to get stage time
* Is the location hosted at a good venue or does it change everytime? This means you'll have same or different crowds of attendees.

These meetups will probably be more crowded and you're better off having a presentation ready and apply to be a speaker. You should do this early on as stage time will give you credibility. I stronlgy suggest preparing a good presentation and not a sales pitch. I will be discussing presenting for developers in a later chapter.

## Pitching is about deliverying value
Obviously, you shouldn't boast about your company's greatness - no one likes a boaster.
When you're going to a meetup you will meet 5 type of people

####The expert 
- A veteran in the technology, has been coming to the meetup since forever and is most likely involved with the organisation of the meetup itself.(Or a speaker at the meetup)

####The intermediate
- Has been using the techonlogy but at the same time its not part of their main stack. Has a good grasp and idea of what to do and not to do with it.

####The newbie
- Has little clue about the technology, wants to learn more and will want to hear experts talk and listen to learn.

####The non-dev
- Has just started coding, has little to no development skill

####I'm here for the free booze
Instead, simply try to open a dialogue with other developers with a ice-breakers.

Each group of users is a different target: In a perfect world you know that if you manage to understand the importance and product fit of what you advocate to the experts, they will use it in production and thus they can be converted into real paying customers. **A company that employes great evangelists can manage to converts thousands of people into paying customers from meetups and other social gatherings**

## Breaking the ice

Opening and starting a dialogue is not hard, and it is a required characteristic of a great evangelist to be good at this. You need to be an extroverted person and that means won't have any problems finding people to chat with.

Being a great evangelist also means you get to talk to **everybody**, sometimes the quiet dude or dudette sitting in a corner looking panicked because he/she does not know anyone in the room is your best ally. Always keep an eye on the quiet attendees, they're interesting people too! You should, as an evangelist, try to make everyone feel comfortable as they're also part of your community - the community you're going to evangelise.
In case you need a few pointers on how to open a dialogue with devs or attendees at meetups here's a few:

####General opening
   "Hey I'm BOB, I'm a dev working at XYZ Inc, we make car-flying technology..what about you?"

####When you spot someone with a nerdy tshirt or an event shirt
   "Hey I love your t-shirt, where did you get it from? Did you attend XYZ event, how was it?"

####When you spot someone wearing a tshirt of one of your competitors:
   "Hey there, woah great t-shirt are you a customer of theirs? What do you think of their product?"


##Evangelising at meetups is about selling helpfulness
When engaging with developers your aim is to understand what they're working on and try to understand whether you can provide your help (this works very well for side projects) or if you think your technology could make their dev-life better: If your product  makes it super simple to send text messages and the person you're having a chat with is telling you about how they're working on setting up 2-factor-authentication, you should understand immediately that there is space to explain how you could help them speed up their go-to-production time of this feature.
