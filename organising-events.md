#Organising Events for developers

As part of the role, as a great community facilitator like yourself, you're going to be running events for the crowd of developers around you.
There is a lot that needs to be done to run an effective event and thus I'd like to talk a bit more about, how developers like their events and what they expect you to deliver.
