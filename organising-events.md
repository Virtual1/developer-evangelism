#Organising Events for developers

As part of the role, as a great community facilitator like yourself, you're going to be running events for the crowd of developers around you.
There is a lot that needs to be done to run an effective event and thus I'd like to talk a bit more about, how developers like their events and what they expect you to deliver.

##Venue
Ease of access is the most important thing you should consider, when looking for a venue to host an event as it will directly affect the way people will consider attending.

Every city has a scene, it's a neighbourhood where most tech companies set their offices, a bit like the financial district in SF is for financial institutions (captain obvious here) and Old Street area is in London for tech companies. If the venue is far from the main scene it means that people cannot just pop-over after work, but instead they'll have to travel all the way. Adding the fact that public transport after office hours is usually swarmed and packed you might have to consider hosting the event in a location where there are a lot of transportation options available or simply is walking distance from a very large hub.

Once the venue location has been isolated, and you've done your best to discuss the possible cost of renting the space, you need to consider the logistics available. This is imperative and is required. As an event organiser this is your sink or swim checklist.
