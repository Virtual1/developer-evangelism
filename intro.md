#Defining a developer evangelist's profile
Developer evangelism is a tough job - sure you get to travel and meet tons of interesting places and people but at the same time it will require a lot of energies and flexibility, as a human.
Ultimately I would define it, and I'll get some hate for saying this, as on-the-field marketing. Selling your product's vision and potential to tech-loving crowds.
By field usually I mean, real people you can see and talk to, but a lot of the selling can be done through web channels, including the big beast that is social media.

Evangelism: It's not for everyone. To be a good developer evangelist you need to be able to multi-task and be excellent at a number of things.

Here's a list:
- Having a great memory or being extremely well organised. It helps to not forget people and things you have to do. These two together (faces,names,places..) tend to become a lot when you work in this space.
- Ability to speak with a lot of people from different backgrounds and manage not to bore them.
- Ability to perform and present regularly in front of techies and non-techies. Maintaining an active public speaking profile is important.
- Be constantly positive (even when you're having a bad day)! There are a number of articles showing how positive people end up (statistically) being more successful than negative ones.
- Able to educate, inspire and motivate people.
- Be patient. Always.
- Be a jack of all trades when it comes to development (full-stack). You will also be the face of your engineering team, being able to solve pains from (potential) customers all the time and they might be using a different stack from yours.
- Be recognized as "that XYZ guy" from "yourcompanyname" that has done/been doing "somethingawesome"

As a developer evangelist you get to wear a lot of different hats, speak in front of crowds with different backgrounds, and manage your day-to-day depending on what you'll be doing or going to next.
Additionally:

- You need to be able to market and sell your product like a pro. Rehearse your dev talks, your sales pitches and your marketing monologue.
- Network like you don't have a job. Always be on the look for interesting people, and if you can help connecting two people do not hesitate to do so - they will remember it and you'll have earned cool points.
- Always be helpful, no matter what it is, if you know it won't take much of your time, just help out. Even if it's 2am. But make sure to help with a context, don't get caught up in other people's issues.
