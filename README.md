developer-evangelism
====================
Been doing evangelism for a while now, thought I would share all I've learned with the world.
I believe this way, I can not only get feedback and suggestions on what I'm doing (or have done) right or wrong but I can finally bring some peace to my mind.

Hope this can help, inspire others to be evangelists. It's great when done right!
