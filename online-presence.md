#Doing the online thing
Itâ€™s really hard and costly to acquire new customers, to build communities and a following. Different sources report that the cost of acquiring a new customer is up to 5x higher than retaining an existing customer. Always keep that in mind when you're tweeting out to reach someone you should focus on keeping your customers as happy as possible!

Different people react in different ways to announcements and you should never put yourself in a position where you could be judged by your negativity or in any way where the words you mention will compromise you. Always try to be as clear and precise as possible and if you don't know the answer don't pretend to. This is especially true for Twitter, where people will jump to conclusions and use anything you say very aggressively, because of the nature of short-messages.

My suggestion is simple, never share any bad news on the internet, always be positive in everything you write, and sometimes a smiliey :) helps take your messages with a grain of humor! Personally I've learned and experienced that sharing a (bad) news in an angry manner never leads to anything productive, let's take a look at a silly example.
"Omg  **service** sux - I just lost 10h building something that doesnt work #hateyou"
could be instead
"Anyone able to help me with **service**, particularly XYZ, please retweet #help"
Now if you were in the social media audience listening for a particular term, which message do you think you'd be more likely wanting to reply to?
Exactly.
