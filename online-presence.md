#Doing the online thing
Itâ€™s really hard and costly to acquire new customers, to build communities and a following. Different sources report that the cost of acquiring a new customer is up to 5x higher than retaining an existing customer. Always keep that in mind when you're tweeting out to reach someone you should focus on keeping your customers as happy as possible!

##Tooling and sites to use

* Tweetdeck: This tool is the king of twitter clients, it allows you to keep track of words(incl. hashtags) to a high complexity level using boolean algebra. You can also set it up to schedule posts in the future so you can post while you sleep and manage multiple accounts from one screen.
* Bufferapp: With Buffer you can schedule tweets, it helps you manage multiple social media accounts at once. It allows you to collaborate on what your brand has to say and analyse its social reach.
* Hootsuite: Similar to the previous one, its a matter of preferences which one to choose (or both ha!)
* Google Advanced Search: Learn how to use Google like a boss, especially when you're looking after your brand - understand how you can leverage to power of in-site search, time-restricted search to query for fresh results mentioning any term of mix of terms. Then you can bookmark the searches into your bookmark bar and have it handy every morning (or whenever you want to dedicate an hour or two to your social media discovery task)
* StackOverflow: Needless to say if you're going to be an evangelist you will have to keep an eye on Stack, lots of technical questions might pop up and you'll need to really do your best to answer them fast! When you engage with this community make sure to just answer the questions and do not try to push the limit too much on promotion as it might get you in trouble!
* Quora

##Positive online aura
Different people react in different ways to announcements and you should never put yourself in a position where you could be judged by your negativity or in any way where the words you mention will compromise you. Always try to be as clear and precise as possible and if you don't know the answer don't pretend to. This is especially true for Twitter, where people will jump to conclusions and use anything you say very aggressively, because of the nature of short-messages.

My suggestion is simple, never share any bad news on the internet, always be positive in everything you write, and sometimes a smiliey :) helps take your messages with a grain of humor! Personally I've learned and experienced that sharing a (bad) news in an angry manner never leads to anything productive, let's take a look at a silly example.

* "Omg  **service** sux - I just lost 10h building something that doesnt work #hateyou"

could be instead

* "Anyone able to help me with **service**, particularly XYZ, please retweet #help"
Now if you were in the social media audience listening for a particular term, which message do you think you'd be more likely wanting to reply to?
Exactly.
