Developer evangelism is a tough job - sure you get to travel and meet tons of interesting places and people but at the same time it will require a lot of energies and flexibility, as a human.

It's not for everyone, to be a good developer evangelist you need to be able to multi-task and be excellent at a number of things.
- Speak with a lot of people from different backgrounds and manage not to bore them.
- Be able to perform and present regularly in front of techies. Maintaining an active public speaking profile is important
- Be constantly positive! There are a number of articles showing how positive people end up (statistically) being more successful than negative ones.
- Able to educate, inspire and motivate.
